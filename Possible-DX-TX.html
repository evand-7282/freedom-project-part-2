   Dirk Strider is one of the most human characters in all of Homestuck. He is incredibly well-written and developed realistically. Being human, it is entirely possible and extremely likely that he suffers from mental illness. In fact, according to <b><a href="http://teenmentalhealth.org/learn/mental-disorders/#:~:text=The%20statistics%20are%20staggering%2C%201,spent%20on%20our%20mental%20health.">teenmentalhealth.org</a></b>, 1 in 5 teens do. Among the most common are anxiety and depression. It’s entirely plausible to assume that Dirk suffers from both of these, which explains a huge portion of his behaviour- from the suicidal tendencies to the intense self-loathing to the need for control. On the other hand, though, Dirk may also be autistic. The characteristics listed here:
      <br>
      

-Him wearing shades means he’s less sensitive to light and he doesn’t have to look people in the eye. 
-Jane is quoted as saying he has a tendency to “go overboard with his projects” (adhering to the whole all or nothing thought pattern consistent with autistic people). 
  -He rarely uses facial expressions or body language. 
-He’s not really aware of other people’s personal space (especially in Jake’s case, as the auto-responder points out). 
  -More often than not he talks at people rather than to them. 
  -He has little interest in interacting with other human beings. (prefers robots) 
-His stress response is to fall back on long, wordy (almost definitely pre memorized) sentences 
-He has a strict routine and a need to adhere to routines (causing him to micromanage everything). 
-He has very specific tastes in food (though this could possibly be due to not having much to begin with). 
-He has difficulty understanding his friends’ perspectives, instead falling back on learned algorithms & patterns about how they behave to determine how they behave. 
  -While his words themselves are creative, his sentence structure is quite repetitive. 
-His incredibly high intelligence level (demonstrated by his many fully functional robots, duplicating his own brain to create his auto-responder, figuring out how to send things through time & space on his own).

All of these traits are consistent with the <b><a href="https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/article?contentid=1494&language=english">presentation of autism</a></b> in adolescent males, leading me to the supported conclusion that Dirk Strider is autistic. Had Homestuck taken place outside of a science fiction universe and not in the far future, it would have been beneficial for Dirk to have seen a therapist at the very least. A common treatment for depression and support for learning disabilities is occupational and psychotherapy in combination with medications to help manage symptoms. Unfortunately, too many teens in today’s world are brushed off or assume symptoms are normal. Compounded with many teachers in the education system not being properly (if at all) trained to accommodate mentally ill students, kids like us fall through the cracks. Incredibly bright kids that “just need to apply ourselves.” Sound familiar? The issue isn’t that we don’t want to succeed, but rather we’re so burnt out from trying to keep ourselves alive. We’re fighting against ourselves every day, and are still expected to be able to have 90’s in every class, to mask our symptoms to suit their classrooms. When do the grades stop defining an individual in a system that has such a double standard for success? We’re told that we just need to do our best, to show off what we’re good at; but what happens when the thing we’re best at is keeping ourselves alive? Shouldn’t that arguably take precedence over a number in the grade book? Unfortunately, this slipping through the cracks is not uncommon for students all over the country and the world. A lot of us are capable of so much when we’re able to do it. But when we’re in a 24/7 fight against our own bodies, we’re exhausted at the most menial of tasks. Now imagine you’re a teacher; if you had Dirk in your classroom that year, how would you be able to keep him motivated and interested? Some ideas include:
<br>
    <ul>
<li>silent communication tools, like coloured post-its and/or hand signals to display a student’s needs.</li>
      <li>flexible grading policies, trusting the student, and what they tell you. </li>
<li>normalize non-curriculum discussion between teachers and students to open up the pathway to out of class communication. </li>
<li> RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH! LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN!
Researching and listening to those who have firsthand experience with mental illness is the most important way to educate yourself on how to respond when you meet another student who may be struggling. Read online how mental illness manifests in others, how people cope, and what you can do as a mentally healthy individual, in a position of power over them, can do. </li>
