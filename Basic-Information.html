      <b> <a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Dirk_Strider">Dirk Strider</a> </b> was “born” (to put it simply) on December 3rd, 2409, growing up in the flooded version of what we know today as Houston, Texas. When he arrived on earth, he had landed in the middle of the new ocean and used his puppet, gifted to him by his brother, as a flotation device to the last standing building in the city. Dirk grew up in the single remaining high rise apartment, completely alone except for what was in the apartment and the puppet, named <b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Lil_Cal">Lil Cal</a></b>. For the most part, he was isolated from anyone else who may have been alive during the time, heavily impacting his development. It is not stated in the story when he meets his friends (known as the alpha kids), but by his thirteenth birthday, they do all consider each other close. Around his thirteenth birthday, Dirk created an exact copy of his consciousness as artificial intelligence (A.I.) to use as an auto-responder. Dirk’s friends, <b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Jake_English">Jake English</a></b>, <b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Roxy_Lalonde">Roxy Lalonde</a></b> , and <b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Jane_Crocker">Jane Crocker</a></b> all communicate with each other through a chat client which, through means of advanced technology, can message users several centuries earlier like Jake and Jane, with Roxy being in the same time as Dirk, but too far away to meet in person, as Roxy lives in the remains of upstate New York. When we as readers are introduced to Dirk, his auto-responder has developed into its own person, and soon is renamed,<b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Lil_Hal"> Hal</a></b> once he and his friends have entered their session in <b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/The_Medium">The Medium</a></b>.

    On page 5641 it is revealed that Dirk is nervous to give the A.I. a body because he doesn’t trust what his own consciousness could be capable of. He also states multiple times that he is sick of himself and his “dismal persona.” He is a passionate person and throws himself full force into everything he does. He gets attached to people when he finally trusts them, takes things seriously, and tends to be very intense. He has strong convictions although matched with his barely-passable social skills and a somewhat obsessive view of social interaction, he can be a bit tiring to be around. He hates feeling vulnerable, which is physically represented by his shades, an accessory he is never seen without. Hiding his eyes can mean multiple things, one being simply to maintain his ‘coolguy’ persona, and another being that since he grew up completely alone and isolated, he never learned social etiquettes such as eye contact and body language. Both could be in play here, and another possibility could be that any emotions showing is perceived by him as weak. Returning to his hatred of feeling vulnerable, he will sometimes try to avoid it to the point of paranoia. Because he has had to fend off danger and fight for himself his entire life, his only means of feeling safe is control, over anything and everything he can. He is not intentionally manipulative, but it is established that one of his major fears is becoming malicious with his need for constant control.
