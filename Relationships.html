      <b>Jake English</b>

	It was revealed by Dirk's auto-responder and then later on by Dirk himself that he has a romantic interest in Jake. If Hal knew about it, this indicates that the affection manifested when Dirk had first created the auto-responder, at age 13 since it is an exact copy of his 13-year-old self’s consciousness. He and Jake were revealed to be dating for several months after entering The Medium, but when the story from their perspective resumes, we see that Jake felt uneasy about the relationship. To Jake, Dirk seemed like an overbearing boyfriend, which is to be expected of someone so deprived of social interaction in their lifetime to be once they latch onto a person of significance, ie a significant other. When Dirk is met with the other Alpha kids in <b><a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Trickster_Mode">Trickster Mode</a></b>, he breaks up with Jake, alluding to him being his romantic interest partially because he was the only viable option because of his sexuality. Later he regrets the way that he broke up with him, saying that “[his] insanity scared him right the f*** off.” Dirk considered himself to be a toxic element of Jake’s life from the start, stemming from his warped perception of himself and his worth. After <b><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story/8087 collide">[S] Collide</a></b>, Dirk and Jake confront each other and they seem to talk through their relationship. In act 7 and in the credits, it’s shown that the two are back on good terms and possibly together again.

        <b>Roxy Lalonde</b>
	Dirk has been aware of Roxy's romantic feelings for him for some time and feels extremely guilty about it since he is unable to reciprocate. Dirk clearly cares very deeply for her in other ways, however, and wants to remain friends without allowing their feelings to cause any issues between each other. He also has shown admiration for her in this conversation with Jane, explaining how he is proud of her and how she's probably stronger than the other three of them put together.

        <b>Dave Strider</b>
	
	Dirk has shown apprehension at the idea of meeting Dave in person, despite saying earlier on that he would like to. This is almost identical to Dave's own trepidation at the idea of meeting Dirk. The first real interaction between the two of them, which takes place prior to their battle with Lord Jack, is forced and awkward, however, they eventually break the ice after Dave tells of his upbringing by his brother, and they begin trading stories of their lives and those of their respective guardians. Dave’s ‘Bro’ was abusive both physically and emotionally, and Dirk being the post-scratch version of him, felt responsible for the trauma that came out of “his” actions, even if he wasn’t the direct cause. Dirk shares plenty of physical similarities to his pre-scratch self, which is pointed out by Dave, and while we don’t get much about how Bro acted socially, it’s implied that both Dirk and Bro share the same tendency to control & teach to aid in personal development, although Bro was malicious in his intentions, and Dirk is not- and it’s one of his biggest fears because he is incredibly aware of what he’s capable of.
